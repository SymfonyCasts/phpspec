# The EnclosureBuilderService

Because we're creating a *lot* of dinosaurs *and* a lot of enclosures, I
think it might be a good idea to get organized and create a new helper service class
to do all of this for us! We'll call it `EnclosureBuilderService`. You know what
that means... time to describe!

```terminal
./vendor/bin/phpspec describe App/Service/EnclosureBuilderService
```

That creates the new spec class. And *thanks* to that new spec class, we can
generate the class immediately with:

```terminal
./vendor/bin/phpspec run
```

Booya!

## Describing the new Feature

New plan time team! Let's add a method to the service where we can pass it
the number of dinosaurs we want, how much security we want, and... it will take
care of the rest! Let's examplify that!

How about `function it_builds_enclosure_with_dinosaurs()`. Inside, let's see, I'd
like to be able to create a new `Enclosure` by saying `$enclosure = $this->buildEnclosure()`.
We'll pass that the number of security systems we want - 1 - and the number of
dinosaurs we want: 2. Then we can do some basic checks, like
`$enclosure->shouldBeAnInstanceOf()` to make sure an `Enclosure` is returned.

[[[ code('0d3e2a30d2') ]]]

Oh, and very important! I want to make sure the new `Enclosure` has *active* security:
`$enclosure->isSecurityActive()`. Wait... but that's not auto-completing - I thought
we added that method! Oh, it *does* exist, but it's private. We'll need to fix that
in a minute. Anyways, use `$enclosure->isSecurityActive()->shouldReturn(true)`.

[[[ code('1796e50af8') ]]]

Simple enough! We're not asserting anything about the dinosaurs yet, but it's a
good start. In `Enclosure`, make `isSecurityActive()` public: we've discovered
that we *do* need to use this from outside of this class. And *because* it's public...
and because I like to keep things organized, let's move it up above the private
methods.

Much better. Let's try this!

```terminal-silent
./vendor/bin/phpspec run
```

It fails, generates the new method for us, then it fails again... because that
method is empty. I hope these steps are boringly routine at this point.

## Implementing the Feature

With the tests red, let's write some code! Open `EnclosureBuilderService` and...
fill in the method! I'll break the arguments onto multiple lines - they're gonna
be a bit long - and advertise that this returns an `Enclosure`. Change the args to
`int $numberOfSecuritySystems` that defaults to 1... though it's entirely up to
you if you want a default - and `int $numberOfDinosaurs = 3`. Then,
`$enclosure = new Enclosure()` and we'll offload the real work to a private method:
`$this->addSecuritySystems($numberOfSecuritySystems, $enclosure)`.

[[[ code('9528c1dc16') ]]]

At the bottom, return `$enclosure` - we'll worry about the dinosaurs in a minute.
For the `addSecuritySystems()` method, I'm going to cheat and paste that in: you
can find this function on the code block on this page. Make sure to re-type the
`y` on `Security` and hit tab to auto-complete that and get the `use` statement
on top.

[[[ code('5ebb0ff203') ]]]

It's nothing special: it takes in the `$numberOfSecuritySystems`, does a `for` loop,
chooses a random name and sets the "is active" flag to true.

We're not adding any dinosaurs yet... which is fine... because we're not asserting
anything about them yet either! We'll worry about that soon. Right now, run phpspec!

```terminal-silent
./vendor/bin/phpspec run
```

Green! This wasn't anything new, but now we have an *awesome* problem. In
`EnclosureBuilderService`, we need to create some dinosaurs... but we are *not*
going to create them by hand. Nope, we already have this beautiful `DinosaurFactory`
that's *great* at growing and hatching Dinosaurs! That means that `EnclosureBuilderService`
will need `DinosaurFactory` as a dependency. And *that* means, in order to finish
the example, we are going to need to mock `DinosaurFactory`.

Awesome. It's next.
